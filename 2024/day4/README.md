# Day 4: Ceres Search

## Description

### Part One

"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the [Ceres monitoring station](/2019/day/10)!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her _word search_ (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: `XMAS`.

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` \- you need to find _all of them_. Here are a few ways `XMAS` might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.`:

```
..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....

```

The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:

```
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX

```

In this word search, `XMAS` occurs a total of _`18`_ times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any `XMAS` have been replaced with `.`:

```
....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX

```

Take a look at the little Elf's word search. _How many times does `XMAS` appear?_
